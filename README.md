# Cup Guessing Game
This app is a java implementation of "the cup guessing game". The game starts with a ball being hidden under cups while a player is watching. The premise of the game is for a player to correctly guess which cup holds the ball. All media files are contained within the source directory (/src). Changing the implementaion should only take place in PirateShellGame.java
